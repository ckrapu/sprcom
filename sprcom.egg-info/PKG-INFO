        `sprcom` stands for **Sp**atial **R**egression of **Com**munities and is a Bayesian statistical package designed to streamline the interpretation and modeling of very high dimensional binary and count-valued data. The underlying model assumes a low-dimensional latent structure via communities or clusters that leads to a parsimonious model. `sprcom` is unique in that it can also account for the dependence of these communities on covariates! A number of utility and plotting functions are included to help visualize your results. `sprcom` is a wrapper for a [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/) model and you can use any PyMC3 estimation method with it including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and ADVI.
        
        ```python
        covariates, response, adjacency = load_data(...)
        n_communities = 5
        model = spatial_community_regression(covariates, response, adjacency,n_communities)
        with model:
          trace = pm.sample()
        ...
        ```
        ## Installation
        You can install this package using pip: `pip install sprcom`. It requires several dependencies including PyMC3 and Seaborn.
        
        We've included documentation to help you get up and running. Check out the `florabank1-tutorial` notebook for more details!
